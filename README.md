# Hi 👋 and Servus!

Let's get straight to it. I have been working as a Progress ABL developer the past 3 years and am currently making the switch to JavaScript and NodeJS.
I used to work as Consultant and Project Manager in several ERP projects before switching to the technical world

I did my master's degree in business informatics at the Otto-Friedrich-University in Bamberg and learned some python, C#, Java, JS, HTML, CSS, R and Angular, but only did some small projects over each semester.
